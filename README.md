I am learning to program in Python and, as a practice, I decided to write a console game called Hangman. As I learn the language, I am planning to update the code for this game. 5

Hangman is a word-guessing game played between the computer and a human player. 4 The gameplay goes as follows:

The computer generates a secret word. 4
There is a limited number of failed attempts that the computer needs to keep track of. 4
The human player tries to guess a letter in the secret word. 4
If the guess is wrong, the number of available tries is reduced, and more pieces of the hanged man picture are revealed. 4
The player continues to try until either the number of available tries is reduced to zero, or the letters in the word are all correctly guessed. 4
Once the number of tries is zero, the complete picture of the hangman is displayed, and the human player loses. 4
