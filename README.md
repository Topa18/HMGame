I am learning to program in Python and, as a practice, I decided to write a console game called Hangman. As I learn the language, I am planning to update the code for this game. 

Hangman is a word-guessing game played between the computer and a human player.  The gameplay goes as follows:

The computer generates a secret word. 
There is a limited number of failed attempts that the computer needs to keep track of. 
The human player tries to guess a letter in the secret word. 
If the guess is wrong, the number of available tries is reduced, and more pieces of the hanged man picture are revealed. 
The player continues to try until either the number of available tries is reduced to zero, or the letters in the word are all correctly guessed. 
Once the number of tries is zero, the complete picture of the hangman is displayed, and the human player loses.
